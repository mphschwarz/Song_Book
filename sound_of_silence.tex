\begin{verse}
^{Am} Hello darkness, my old ^{G}friend \\
^{G} I've come to talk with you ^{Am}again \\
Because a vision ^{F}softly ^{C}creeping \\
Left its seeds while I ^{F}was ^{C}sleeping \\
And the ^{F}vision that was planted in my ^{C}brain \\
Still remains ^{Am} \\
Within the ^{G}sound of ^{Am}silence
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am} In restless dreams I walked ^{G}alone \\
^{G} Narrow streets of cobble - ^{Am}stone \\
'Neath the halo of ^{F}a street ^{C}lamp \\
I turned my collar to the ^{F}cold and ^{C}damp \\
When my ^{F}eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon ^{C}light \\
That split the night ^{Am} \\
And ^{C}touched the ^{G}sound of ^{Am}silence
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am} And in the naked light I ^{G}saw \\
^{G} Ten thousand people, maybe ^{Am}more \\
People talking ^{F}without ^{C}speaking \\
People hearing ^{F}without ^{C}listening \\
People writing ^{F}songs that voices never ^{C}share \\
And no one dared ^{Am} \\
^{C}Disturb the ^{G}sound of ^{Am}silence
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{Am} "Fools", said I, "You do not ^{G}know \\
^{G} Silence like a cancer ^{Am}grows \\
Hear my words that I ^{F}might teach ^{C}you \\
Take my arms that I ^{F}might reach ^{C}you" \\
But my ^{F}words, like silent raindrops ^{C}fell ^{Am} \\
And ^{C}echoed \\
In the ^{C}wells of ^{Am}silence
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am} And the people bowed and ^{G}prayed \\
^{G} To the neon god they ^{Am}made \\
And the sign flashed out ^{F}its ^{C}warning \\
In the words that it ^{F}was ^{C}forming \\
And the sign said, "The ^{F}words of the prophets are written on the subway ^{C}walls \\
And tenement halls" ^{Am} \\
And ^{C}whispered in the ^{G}sounds of ^{Am}silence
