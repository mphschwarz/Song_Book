\capo

\begin{verse}
^{Am}An old cowboy went riding out one ^{C}dark and windy day \\
^{Am}Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way \\
^{Am}When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw \\
^{F}A-plowing through the ragged sky and ^{Dm}up the cloudy ^{Am}draw
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am}Their brands were still on fire and their ^{C}hooves were made of steel \\
^{Am}Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel \\
^{Am}A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky \\
^{F}For he saw the Riders coming hard and he ^{Dm}heard their mournful ^{Am}cry
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{Am}Yippie yi ^{C}Ohhhhh \\
^{C}Yippie yi ^{Am}yaaaaay \\
^{F}Ghost Riders in the ^{Am}sky
\end{chorus}
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am}Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their ^{C}shirts all soaked with sweat \\
^{Am}He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet \\
^{Am}'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky \\
^{F}On horses snorting fire, as they ^{Dm}ride on hear their ^{Am}cry
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am}As the riders loped on by him he ^{C}heard one call his name \\
^{Am}If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range \\
^{Am}Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride \\
^{F}Trying to catch the Devil's herd, ^{Dm}across these endless ^{Am}skies
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{Am}Yippie yi ^{C}Ohhhhh \\
^{C}Yippie yi ^{Am}yaaaaay \\
^{F}Ghost Riders in the ^{Am}sky
\end{chorus}
