\begin{verse}
^*{E}Suz anne takes you down to her place near the river \\
You can ^{F#m}hear the boats go by, you can spend the night beside her \\
And you ^{E}know that she's half-crazy, but that's why you wanna be there \\
And she ^{G#m}feeds you tea and oranges that come ^{A}all the way from China \\
And just ^{E} when you mean to tell her that you ^{F#m}have no love to give her \\
Then she ^{E}gets you on her wavelength, and she ^{F#m}lets the river answer \\
That you've ^*{E}al ways been her lover
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
And you ^{G#m}want to travel with her, and you ^{A}want to travel blind \\
And you ^{E}know she will trust you for you've ^{F#m}touched her perfect body ... With your ^{E}mind
\end{chorus}
 
\begin{verse}
And ^{E}Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water \\
And he ^{F#m}spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower \\
And ^{E}when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him \\
He said: "^{G#m}All men will be sailors then un^{A}til the sea shall free them" \\
But ^{E}he himself was broken long be^{F#m}fore the sky would open \\
For^{E}saken, almost human, he ^{F#m}sank beneath your wisdom \\
Like a ^{E}stone
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
And you ^{G#m}want to travel with him, and you ^{A}want to travel blind \\
And you ^{E}think maybe you'll trust him for he's ^{F#m}touched your perfect body ... With his ^{E}mind
\end{chorus}
 
\begin{verse}
Now Suz^{E}anne takes your hand, and she leads you to the river \\
She is ^*{F#m}wear ing rags and feathers from the Salvation Army counter \\
And the ^{E}sun pours down like honey on Our Lady of the Harbour \\
And she ^{G#m}shows you where to look among the ^*{A}gar bage and the flowers \\
There are ^{E} heroes in the seaweed, there are ^*{F#m}child ren in the morning \\
They are ^*{E}lean ing out for love, and they will ^{F#m}lean that way forever \\
While Suz^{E}anne holds the mirror
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
And you ^{G#m}want to travel with her, and you ^{A}want to travel blind \\
And you ^{E}know that you can trust her for she's ^*{F#m}touch ed your perfect body ... With her ^{E}mind
\end{chorus}
