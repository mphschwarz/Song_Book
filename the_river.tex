\begin{song}{title = The River}

\begin{verse}
I ^{Em}come from down in the ^{G}valley \tab 
Where ^{D}mister, when you're ^{C}young \\
They ^{Em}bring you up to ^{G}do \tab
^{C}Like your daddy ^{G}done \\
Me and ^{C}Mary we met in high school  \tab
When ^{G}she was just ^{D}seven- ^{Em}teen \\
We'd ^{Am}drive out of this valley down \tab
To ^{G}where the fields were ^{C}green
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
We'd go ^{Em}down to the ^{C}river \hfill
And ^{D}into the river we'd ^{G}dive \hfill
Oh ^{Em}down to the ^{C}river we’d ^{D}ride ^{C}
\end{chorus}
 
\begin{verse}
Then ^{Em}I got Mary ^{G}pregnant \tab
And ^{D}man, that was all she ^{C}wrote \\
And ^{Em}for my 19th ^{G}birthday \tab
I got a union ^{C}card and a wedding ^{G}coat \\
We ^{C}went down to the courthouse \tab
And the ^{G}judge put it ^{D}all to ^{Em}rest \\
No ^{Am}wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle \tab
No ^{G}flowers, no wedding ^{C}dress
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
We'd go ^{Em}down to the ^{C}river \hfill
And ^{D}into the river we'd ^{G}dive \hfill
Oh ^{Em}down to the ^{C}river we’d ^{D}ride ^{C}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
I ^{Em}got a job working ^{G}construction \tab
For the ^{D}Johnstown ^{C}Company \\
But ^{Em}lately there ain't been ^{G}much work \tab
On ^{C}account of the ^{G}economy \\
Now ^{C}all them things that seemed so important \tab
Well mister ^{G}they vanished right ^{D}into the air ^{Em} \\
Now I just ^{Am}act like I don't remember \tab
Mary ^{G}acts like she don't ^{C}care
\end{verse}
 
\begin{bridge}
But I ^{Em}remember us riding in my ^{G}brother's car \tab
Her body ^{D}tan and wet down at the ^{C}reservoir \\
At ^{Em}night on them banks I'd ^{G}lie awake \tab
And pull her ^{C}close just to feel each ^{G}breath she'd take \\
Now those ^{C}memories come back to haunt me \tab
They ^{G}haunt me ^{D}like a ^{Em}curse \\
Is a ^{Am}dream a lie if it don't come true \tab
Or ^{G}is it something ^{C}worse
\end{bridge}
 
\begin{chorus}
That sends me ^{Em}down to the ^{C}river \tab
Though I ^{D}know the river is ^{G}dry \\
That sends me ^{Em}down to the ^{C}river ^{D}tonight ^{C} \\
^{Em}Down to the ^{C}river \tab
my ^{D}baby and ^{G}I \\
Oh ^{Em}down to the ^{C}river we ^{D}ride ^{C}Ooh...
\end{chorus}
