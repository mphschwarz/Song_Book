\begin{song}{title = Foggy Dew}

\begin{verse}
As ^{Am} down the glen one ^{G}Easter ^{Em}morn to a ^{C}city ^{G}fair rode ^{Am} I, \\
^{Am}Their armed lines of ^{G}marching ^{Em}men in ^{C}squadrons ^{G}passed me ^{Am}by; \\
^{C}No pipe did hum, nor ^{G}battle ^{Am}drum did sound its ^{G}loud ^{Am}tattoo, \\
But the ^{Am}Angelus bell o'er the ^{G}Liffey's ^{Em}swell rang ^{C}out through the ^{Em}Foggy ^{Am}Dew.
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
Right ^{Am}proudly high o'er ^{G}Dublin ^{Em}Town they ^{C}hung out the ^{G}flag of ^{Am}war, \\
Twas ^{Am}better to die neath an ^{G}Irish ^{Em}sky than at ^{C}Suvla or ^{G}Sud El ^{Am}Bar; \\
And ^{C}from the plains of ^{G}Royal ^{Am}Meath strong men came ^{G}hurrying ^{Am}through, \\
While ^{Am}Brittania's sons, with their ^{G}long range ^{Em}guns, sailed ^{C}in through the ^{Em}Foggy ^{Am}Dew.
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
O, the ^{Am}night fell black, and the ^{G}rifles ^{Em}crack made ^{C}Perfidious ^{G}Albion ^{Am}reel, \\
'Mid the ^{Am}leaden rain, seven ^{G}tongues of ^{Em}flame did ^{C}shine o'er the ^{G}lines of ^{Am}steel; \\
By each ^{C}shinning blade a ^{G}prayer was said that to ^{Am}Ireland her ^{G}sons be ^{Am}true, \\
And when ^{Am}morning broke still the ^{G}war flag ^{Em}shook out it's ^{C}folds in the ^{Em}Foggy ^{Am}Dew.
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
'Twas ^{Am}England bade our ^{G}Wild Geese ^{Em}go that ^{C}small nations ^{G}might be ^{Am}free, \\
But their ^{Am}lonely graves are by ^{G}Suvla's ^{Em}waves or the ^{C}shores of the ^{G}Great North ^{Am}Sea. \\
Oh ^{C}had they died by ^{G}Pearse's ^{Am}side or had fought with ^{G}Cathal ^{Am}Brugha, \\
Their ^{Am}names we'd keep where the ^{G}Fenians ^{Em}sleep, 'neath the ^{C}shroud of the ^{Em}Foggy ^{Am}Dew
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
But the ^{Am}bravest fell, and the ^{G}requiem ^{Em}bell rang ^{C}mournfully ^{G}and ^{Am}clear, \\
For ^{Am}those who died that ^{G}Easter - ^{Em}tide in the ^{C}springtime of ^{G}the ^{Am}year. \\
While the ^{C}world did gaze with ^{G}deep ^{Am}amaze at those fearless ^{G}men but ^{Am}few, \\
Who ^{Am}bore the fight that ^{G}freedom's ^{Em}light might ^{C}shine through the ^{Em}Foggy ^{Am}Dew,
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
Back ^{Am}through the glen I ^{G}rode ^{Em}again, and my ^{C}heart with ^{G}grief was ^{Am}sore, \\
For I ^{Am}parted then with ^{G}valient ^{Em}men who I ^{C}never ^{G}shall see ^{Am}no more; \\
But ^{C}to and from in my ^{G}dreams I ^{Am}go, and I'd kneel and ^{G}pray for ^{Am}you, \\
For ^{Am}slavery fled, O' ^{G} glorious ^{Em}dead when you ^{C} fell in the ^{Em}Foggy ^{Am}Dew.
\end{verse}
