\begin{song}{title = Me and Bobby McGee}

\begin{verse}
^{G}Busted flat in ^{G}Baton Rouge, ^{G} waitin' for a ^{G}train \hfill
When I's ^{G}feelin' near as ^{G}faded as ^{D7}my jeans ^{D7} \\
^{D7}Bobby thumbed a ^{D7}diesel down ^{D7}just before it ^{D7}rained \hfill
And ^{D7}rode us all the ^{D7}way into New ^{G}Orl - ^{C/G}eans ^{G} \\
I ^{G}pulled my ^{G}harpoon out of my ^{G}dirty red ^{G}bandana \hfill
I's ^{G}playin' soft while ^{G7}Bobby sang the ^{C}blues ^{C} \\
^{C}Windshield wipers ^{C}slappin' time, I was ^{G}holdin' Bobby's ^{G}hand in mine \hfill
^{D7}We sang every ^{D7}song that driver ^{D7}knew
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{C}Freedom's just ^{C}another word for ^{G} nothin' left to ^{G}lose \\
^{D7}Nothin', it ain't ^{D7}nothin' honey, if it ain't ^{G}free ^{G} \\
And ^{C}feelin' good was ^{C}easy, lord, oh, ^{G} when he sang the ^{G}blues \\
You know ^{D7}feelin' good was ^{D7}good enough for ^{D7}me ^{D7} \\
^{D7}Good enough for ^{D7}me and my Bobby ^{G}McGee ^{G} ^{A} ^{A}
\end{chorus}
 
\begin{verse}
From the ^{A}Kentucky ^{A}coal mines to the ^{A}California ^{A}sun \hfill
Yeah ^{A}Bobby shared the ^{A}secrets of my ^{E7} soul ^{E7} \\
Through ^{E7}all kinds of ^{E7}weather, through ^{E7}everything we ^{E7}done \hfill
Yeah ^{E7}Bobby baby ^{E7}kept me from the ^{A}cold ^{A} \\
One ^{A}day up near ^{A}Salinas, lo-ord, ^{A} I let him slip ^{A}away \hfill
He's ^{A}lookin' for that ^{A7}home and I hope he ^{D}finds it \\
Well I'd ^{D}trade all my ^{D}tomorrows for one ^{A}single ^{A}yesterday \hfill
To be ^{E7}holdin' Bobby's ^{E7}body next to ^{E7}mine ^{E7}
\end{verse}
