\capo
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am} On a dark desert highway, ^{E7} cool wind in my hair \\
^{G} Warm smell of colitas ^{D} rising up through the air \\
^{F} Up ahead in the distance, ^{C} I saw a shimmering light \\
^{Dm} My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, ^{E} I had to stop for the night
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am} There she stood in the doorway, ^{E7}I heard the mission bell \\
^{G} And I was thinking to myself: This could be ^{D}heaven or this could be hell \\
^{F} Then she lit up a candle, ^{C} and she showed me the way \\
^{Dm} There were voices down the corridor, ^{E7} I thought I heard them say...
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{F} Welcome to the Hotel ^{C}California \\
Such a ^{E7}lovely place (such a lovely place), such a ^{Am}lovely face \\
There's ^{F}plenty of room at the Hotel ^{C}California \\
Any ^{Dm}time of year, (any time of year) You can ^{E7}find it here...
\end{chorus}
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am} Her mind is Tiffany twisted, ^{E7} She got the Mercedes bends \\
^{G} She got a lot of pretty pretty boys ^{D} that she calls friends \\
^{F} How they danced in the courtyard, ^{C}sweet summer sweat \\
^{Dm} Some dance to remember, ^{E7} some dance to forget
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am} So I called up the captain; ^{E7}"Please bring me my wine" (he said) \\
^{G} "We haven't had that spirit here since ^{D} 1969" \\
^{F} And still those voices are calling from ^{C}far away \\
^{Dm} Wake you up in the middle of the night ^{E7} Just to hear them say...
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{F} Welcome to the Hotel ^{C}California \\
Such a ^{E7}lovely place (such a lovely place), such a ^{Am}lovely face \\
They're ^{F}livin' it up at the Hotel ^{C}California \\
What a ^{Dm}nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your ^{E7}alibis
\end{chorus}

\pagebreak
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am} Mirrors on the ceiling, ^{E7} the pink champagne on ice (and she said) \\
^{G} We are all just prisoners here, ^{D} of our own device \\
^{F} And in the master's chambers, ^{C} they gathered for the feast \\
^{Dm} They stab it with their steely knives, but they ^{E7}Just can't kill the beast
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
^{Am} Last thing I remember, I was ^{E7} running for the door \\
^{G} I had to find the passage back to the ^{D}place I was before \\
^{F} "Relax" said the night man, "we are ^{C} programmed to receive, \\
^{Dm} You can check out any time you like ^{E7} But you can never leave"
\end{verse}
