^{Em} It can't be ^{D/F#}said I'm an ^{G}early bird \\
It's ten o'^{Am}clock be^{C/B}fore I ^{C}say a word \\
Baby, I can never ^{D}tell \\
How do you sleep so ^{B7}well? \\
 
You keep telling me to ^{Em}live right \\
To go to ^{D/F#}bed before the ^*{G}day light \\
But then you ^{Am}wake up ^{C/B}for the ^*{C}sun rise \\
You know you don't gotta pre^{G}tend \\
Baby, now and ^{D/F#}then
\end{verse}
 
\begin{bridge}
Don't you just wanna ^{Em}wake up, dark as a lake? \\
Smel^{D/F#}ling like a ^{G}bonfire, lost in a haze? \\
If ^{Am}you're drunk ^{C/B}on ^{C}life, babe, I think it's great \\
But while in this ^{D}world

\begin{verse}
I aim ^{Em}low \\
I aim true and the ^{D/F#}ground's where I ^{G}go \\
I work late where I'm ^{Am}free ^{C/B}from the ^{C}phone \\
And the job gets done \\
But you ^{D}worry some, I ^{B7}know \\
 
But who wants to live for^{Em}ever, babe? \\
You treat your ^{D/F#}mouth as if it's ^{G}Heaven's gate \\
The rest of ^{Am}you like ^{C/B}you're the ^{C}TSA \\
I wish I could go a^{G}long, babe, don't get me ^{D/F#}wrong
\end{verse}
 
\begin{bridge}
You know you're bright as the ^{Em}morning, as soft as the rain \\
Pre^{D/F#}tty as a ^{G}vine, as sweet as a grape \\
If you can ^{Am}sit ^{C/B}in a ^{C}barrel, maybe I'll wait \\
Until that ^{D}day
