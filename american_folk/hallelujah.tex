\begin{verse}
I ^{C}heard there was a ^{Am}secret chord \\\
That ^{C}David played and it ^{Am}pleased the Lord \\
But ^{F}you don't really ^{G}care for music, ^{C}do you? ^{G} \\
Well it ^{C}goes like this the ^{F}fourth, the ^{G}fifth \\
The ^{Am}minor fall and the ^{F}major lift \\
The ^{G}baffled king ^{E7}composing ^{Am}hallelujah
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{F}Hallelujah, ^{Am}hallelujah, ^{F}hallelujah, \\
^{C}hallelu - ^{G}u - u - u - ^{C}jah ^{Am}
\end{chorus}

 
\begin{verse}
Well, your ^{C}faith was strong but you ^{Am}needed proof \\
You ^{C}saw her bathing ^{Am}on the roof \\
Her ^{F}beauty and the ^{G}moonlight ^{C}overthrew you ^{G} \\
She ^{C}tied you to her ^{F}kitchen ^{G}chair \\
She ^{Am}broke your throne and she ^{F}cut your hair \\
And ^{G}from your lips she ^{E7}drew the ^{Am}hallelujah
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{F}Hallelujah, ^{Am}hallelujah, ^{F}hallelujah, \\
^{C}hallelu - ^{G}u - u - u - ^{C}jah ^{Am}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{C}Baby, I've been ^{Am}here before \\
I've ^{C}seen this room and I've ^{Am}walked this floor \\
I ^{F}used to live ^{G}alone before I ^{C}knew you ^{G} \\
I've ^{C}seen your flag on the ^{F}marble ^{G}arch \\
But ^{Am}love is not a ^{F}victory march \\
It's a ^{G}cold and it's a ^{E7}broken ^{Am}hallelujah
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{F}Hallelujah, ^{Am}hallelujah, ^{F}hallelujah, \\
^{C}hallelu - ^{G}u - u - u - ^{C}jah ^{Am}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Well, there ^{C}was a time when you ^{Am}let me know \\
What's ^{C}really going ^{Am}on below \\
But ^{F}now you never ^{G}show that to me ^{C}do you ^{G} \\
But ^{C}remember when I ^{F}moved in ^{G}you \\
And the ^{Am}holy dove was ^{F}moving too \\
And ^{G}every breath we ^{E7}drew was ^{Am}hallelujah
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{F}Hallelujah, ^{Am}hallelujah, ^{F}hallelujah, \\
^{C}hallelu - ^{G}u - u - u - ^{C}jah ^{Am}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Well, ^{C}maybe there's a ^{Am}God above \\
But ^{C}all I've ever ^{Am}learned from love \\
Was ^{F}how to shoot ^{G}somebody who ^{C}outdrew you ^{G} \\
It's ^{C}not a cry that you ^{F}hear at ^{G}night \\
It's ^{Am}not somebody who's ^{F}seen the light \\
It's a ^{G}cold and it's a ^{E7}broken ^{Am}hallelujah
