\begin{verse}
As ^{G}I was goin' over the ^{Em}far famed Kerry mountains, \\
I ^{C}met with Captain Farrel and his ^{G}money he was ^{D}countin' \\

Sayin' ^{C} "Stand and deliver for you ^{G}are a bold deceiver"

There's ^{G}whiskey ^{D}in the ^{G}jar.
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
I ^{G}counted out his money and it ^{Em}made a pretty penny \\
I ^{C}put it in me pocket and I ^{G}took it home to my ^{D}Jenny \\
She ^{G}sighed and she swore that she ^{Em}never would deceive me \\
But the ^{C}devil take the women for they ^{G}never can be easy

\begin{chorus}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
I ^{G}went up to my chamber, all ^{Em}for to take a slumber \\
I ^{C}dreamt of gold and jewels and for ^{G}sure 't was no ^{D}wonder \\
But ^{G}Jenny drew me charges and she ^{Em}filled them up with water \\
Then ^{C}sent for captain Farrell to be ^{G}ready for the slaughter \\

\end{chorus}
 
\begin{verse}
't was ^{G}early in the morning, just ^{Em}before I rose to travel \\
Up ^{C}comes a band of footmen and ^{G}likewise captain ^{D}Farrell \\

I ^{C}couldn't shoot the water, so a ^{G}prisoner I was taken

\begin{verse}
Now ^{G}there's some take delight in the ^{Em}carriages a rolling \\

\begin{verse}
If ^{G}anyone can aid me 't is me ^{Em}brother in the army \\
If ^{C}I can find his station in ^{G}Cork or in ^{D}Killarney \\

And ^{C}I'm sure he'll treat me better than my ^{G}own a-sporting Jenny
