\begin{verse}
She ^{Am}came to me one morning, \\
one ^{Am}lonely Sunday morning \\
Her ^{G}long hair flowing, \\
in the ^{Am}midwinter wind \\
I ^{Am}know not how she found me, \\
for in ^{Am}darkness I was walking \\
And ^{G}destruction lay around me, \\
from a ^{Am}fight I could not win
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{Am}Ah ah ah  ^{G}ah ^{Am}ah \tab
^{Am}Ah ^{G}ah ^{Am}ah ...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
She ^{Am}asked me name my foe then, \\
I ^{Am}said the need within some men \\
To ^{G}fight and kill their brothers, \\
without ^{Am}thought of love or God \\
And I ^{Am}begged her give me horses, \\
to ^{Am}trample down my enemies \\
So ^{G}eager was my passion, \\
to ^{Am}devour this waste of life
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{Am}Ah ah ah  ^{G}ah ^{Am}ah \tab
^{Am}Ah ^{G}ah ^{Am}ah ...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
But she ^{Am}wouldn t think of battle that, \\
^{Am}reduces men to animals \\
So ^{G}easy to begin, \\
and yet ^{Am}impossible to end \\
For ^{Am}she s the mother of our men, \\
who ^{Am}counseled me so wisely then \\
I ^{G}feared to walk alone again, \\
and ^{Am}asked if she would stay
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{Am}Ah ah ah  ^{G}ah ^{Am}ah \tab
^{Am}Ah ^{G}ah ^{Am}ah ...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Oh, ^{Am}lady lend your hand outright, \\
and ^{Am}let me rest here at your side \\
Have ^{G}faith and trust in peace she said, \\
and ^{Am}filled my heart with life \\
There ^{Am}is no strength in numbers, \\
have ^{Am}no such misconception \\
But ^{G}when you need me, \\
be assured I ^{Am}won t be far away
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{Am}Ah ah ah  ^{G}ah ^{Am}ah \tab
^{Am}Ah ^{G}ah ^{Am}ah ...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Thus ^{Am}having spoke she turned away, \\
and ^{Am}though I found no words to say \\
I ^{G}stood and watched until I saw, \\
her ^{Am}black coat disappear \\
My ^{Am}labor is no easier, \\
but ^{Am}now I know I m not alone \\
I ^{G}find new heart each time, \\
I think ^{Am}upon that windy day \\
And ^{Am}if one day she comes to you, \\
drink ^{Am}deeply from her words so wise \\
Take ^{G}courage from her as your prize, \\
and ^{Am}say hello from me
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{Am}Ah ah ah  ^{G}ah ^{Am}ah \tab
^{Am}Ah ^{G}ah ^{Am}ah ...
\end{chorus}
