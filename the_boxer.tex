\begin{verse}
^{C}I am just a poor boy, though my story's ^{C/B}seldom ^{Am}told \\
I have ^{G}squandered my resistance \\
For a ^{G7}pocketful of ^{G6}mumbles such are ^{C}promises \\
All ^{C/B}lies and ^{Am}jest still a ^{G}man hears what he ^{F}wants to hear \\
And disregards the ^{C}rest ^{G} ^{F} ^{G} ^{C}
\end{verse}

When I ^{C}left my home and family I was no more ^{C/B}than a ^{Am}boy \\
In the ^{G}company of strangers \\
In the ^{G7}quiet of a ^{G6}railway station ^{C}running scared \\
^{C/B}Laying ^{Am}low seeking ^{G}out the poorer ^{F}quarters where the ragged people ^{C}go \\
Looking ^{G}for the places ^{F}only ^{G}they would ^{C}know
\end{verse}

Asking ^{C}only workmans wages I come looking ^{C/B}for a ^{Am}job \\
But I get no ^{G}offers \\
Just a ^{G7}come-on from the ^{G6}whores on Seventh ^{C}Avenue \\
I ^{C/B}do ^{Am}declare there were ^{G}times when I was ^{F}so lonesome \\
I took some comfort ^{C}there \hfill La - la - ^{G}la - la - la - la - la ^{C}

Then I'm ^{C}laying out my winter clothes and wishing ^{C/B}I was ^{Am}gone \\

\begin{verse}
In the ^{C}clearing stands a boxer and a fighter ^{C/B}by his ^{Am}trade \\
And he ^{G}carries the reminders \\
Of ^{G7}ev'ry glove that ^{G6}laid him down or ^{C}cut him till he cried out \\
In his anger ^{C/B}and his ^{Am}shame \\
"I am ^{G}leaving, I am ^{F}leaving." but the fighter still ^{C}remains \\
Hm, hm, ^{G}hm ^{F} ^{G} ^{C}
