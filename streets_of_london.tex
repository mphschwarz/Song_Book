\begin{song}{title = Streets of London}

\begin{verse}
^{C}Have you seen the ^{G}old man in the ^{Am}closed-down ^{Em}market \hfill
^{F}Kicking up the ^{C/G}paper with his ^{Dm/F}worn-out ^{G}shoes? \\
^{C}In his eyes you ^{G}see no pride, ^{Am}and held loosely ^{Em}at his side \hfill
^{F} Yesterday's ^{C/G}paper telling ^{G7}yesterday's ^{C}news
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
So ^{F}how can you ^{Em}tell me you're ^{C}lo - ^{G/B}ne - ^{Am}ly ^{Am/G} \hfill
^{D7/F#}and say for you that the sun don't ^{G}shine? ^{G7} \\
^{C}Let me take you ^{G}by the hand and ^{Am}lead you through the ^{Em}streets of London, \\
^{F} I'll show you ^{C/G}something to ^{G7}make you change your ^{C}mind
\end{chorus}
 
\begin{verse}
^{C}Have you seen the ^{G}old girl who ^{Am}walks the streets of ^{Em}London \hfill
^{F}Dirt in her ^{C/G}hair and her ^{Dm/F}clothes in ^{G}rags? \\
^{C}She's no time for ^{G}talking, she ^{Am}just keeps right on ^{Em}walking \hfill
^{F}Carrying her ^{C/G}home in ^{G7}two carrier ^{C}bags ^{C}
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{C}In the all-night ^{G}cafe at a ^{Am}quarter past ^{Em}eleven \hfill
^{F}Same old ^{C/G}man sitting ^{Dm/F}there on his ^{G}own \\
^{C}Looking at the ^{G}world over the ^{Am}rim of his ^{Em}tea-cup \hfill
^{F}Each tea lasts an ^{C/G}hour, and he ^{G7}wanders home ^{C}alone ^{C}
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{C/G}Have you seen the ^{G}old man ^{Am}outside the seaman's ^{Em}mission? \hfill
^{F}Memory fading ^{C/G}with the medal ^{Dm/F}ribbons that he ^{G}wears \\
^{C}In our winter ^{G}city the rain ^{Am}cries a little ^{Em}pity \hfill
For ^{F}one more forgotten ^{C/G}hero and a ^{G7}world that doesn't ^{C}care ^{C}
