^{Am}Jolene, ^{C}Jolene, ^{G}Jolene, ^{Am}Jolene \\
I'm ^{G}begging of you, please don't take my ^{Am}man \\
^{Am}Jolene, ^{C}Jolene, ^{G}Jolene, ^{Am}Jolene \\
^{G}Please don't take him ^{Em}just because you ^{Am}can
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Your ^{Am}beauty is ^{C}beyond compare \\
With ^{G}flaming locks of ^{Am}auburn hair \\
With ^{G}ivory skin and ^{Em}eyes of emerald ^{Am}green \\
Your ^{Am}smile is like a ^{C}breath of spring \\
Your ^{G}voice is soft like ^{Am}summer rain \\
And I ^{G}cannot ^{Em}compete with you, ^{Am}Jolene
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
He ^{Am}talks about you ^{C}in his sleep \\
^{G}There's nothing I can ^{Am}do to keep \\
From ^{G}crying when he ^{Em}calls your name, ^{Am}Jolene \\
And ^{Am}I can easily ^{C}understand \\
How ^{G}you could easily ^{Am}take my man \\
But you ^{G}don't know what he ^{Em}means to me, ^{Am}Jolene
\end{verse}

^{G}Please don't take him ^{Em}just because you ^{Am}can
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{Am}You could have your ^{C}choice of men \\
But ^{G}I could never ^{Am}love again \\
^{G}He's the only ^{Em}one for me, ^{Am}Jolene \\
I ^{Am}had to have this ^{C}talk with you \\
My ^{G}happiness ^{Am}depends on you \\
And ^{G}whatever you ^{Em}decide to do, ^{Am}Jolene
\end{verse}
