\begin{verse}
^{D}Riding on the ^{A}City of ^{D}New Orleans \\
^{Bm}Illinois Central, ^{G}Monday morning ^{D}rail ^{A} \\
^{D}Fifteen cars and ^{A}fifteen restless ^{D}riders \\
^{Bm}Three conductors and ^{A}twenty-five sacks of ^{D}mail. \\
All ^{Bm}along the south bound odyssey, \\
the ^{F#m}train pulls out of Kankakee \\
^{A}Rolls along past houses, farms and ^{E}fields \\
^{Bm}Passing trains that have no name, \\
^{F#m}freight yards full of old black men \\
And the ^{A}graveyards of the ^{A7}rusted ^{D}automobiles.
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}[template = framed]
^{G}Good morning ^{A}America, how ^{D}are you? \\
Say, ^{Bm}don't you know me, ^{G}I'm your native ^{D}son. \\
^{A7}I'm the   ^{D}train they call \\
the ^{A}City of ^{Bm}New Orleans ^{E7} \\
I'll be ^{C}gone five ^{G}hundred ^{A}miles \\
when the ^{A7}day is ^{D}done.
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Dealing ^{D}card games with the ^{A}old men in the ^{D}club car \\
^{Bm}Penny a point, ain't ^{G}no one keeping ^{D}score ^{A} \\
^{D}Pass the paper ^{A}bag that holds the ^{D}bottle \\
^{Bm}Feel the wheels ^{A}rumblin' 'neath the ^{D}floor \\
And the ^{Bm}sons of Pullman porters \\
and the ^{F#m}sons of engineers \\
^{A}Ride their fathers' magic carpets made of ^{E}steel \\
^{Bm}Mothers with their babes asleep, \\
^{F#m}rockin' to the gentle beat \\
And the ^{A}rhythm of the ^{A7}rails is all they ^{D}feel.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{D}Night time on the ^{A}City of ^{D}New Orleans \\
^{Bm}Changing cars in ^{G}Memphis, ^{D}Tennessee ^{A} \\
^{D}Halfway home, ^{A}we'll be there by ^{D}morning \\
through the ^{Bm}Mississippi darkness ^{A}rolling down to the ^{D}sea. \\
But ^{Bm}all the towns and people seem \\
to ^{F#m}fade into a bad dream \\
And the ^{A}steel rail still ain't heard the ^{E}news \\
The ^{Bm}conductor sings his songs again, \\
the ^{F#m}passengers will please refrain \\
This ^{A}train got the ^{A7}disappearing railroad ^{D}blues.
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{G}Good night ^{A}America, how ^{D}are you? ...
