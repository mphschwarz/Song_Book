\begin{verse}
The ^{Am}last that ever she ^{F}saw him \\
^{G}Carried away by a ^{C}moonlight ^{G}shadow \\
He ^{Am}passed on worried and ^{F}warning \\
^{G}Carried away by a ^{C}moonlight ^{G}shadow. \\
^{C}Lost in a riddle that ^{G}Saturday night \\
^{Am}Far ^{F}away on the ^{G}other side. \\
He was ^{C}caught in the middle of a ^{G}desperate fight \\
And she ^{Am}couldn't find ^{F}how to push ^{G}through
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
The ^{Am}trees that whisper in the ^{F}evening \\
^{G}Carried away by a ^{C}moonlight ^{G}shadow \\
Sing a ^{Am}song of sorrow and ^{F}grieving \\
^{G}Carried away by a ^{C}moonlight ^{G}shadow \\
^{C}All she saw was a ^{G}silhouette of a gun \\
^{Am}Far ^{F}away on the ^{G}other side. \\
He was ^{C}shot six times by a ^{G}man on the run \\
And she ^{Am}couldn't find ^{F}how to push ^{G}through

^{Am}Four am in the ^{F}morning \\
^{G}Carried away by a ^{C}moonlight ^{G}shadow \\
I ^{Am}watched your vision ^{F}forming \\
^{G}Carried away by a ^{C}moonlight ^{G}shadow \\
^{C}Star was light in a ^{G}silvery night \\

Will you ^{C}come to talk to ^{G}me this night \\
But she ^{Am}couldn't find ^{F}how to push ^{G}through

^{C}Caught in the middle of a ^{G}hundred and five \\
The ^{C}night was heavy but the ^{G}air was alive \\
But she ^{Am}couldn't find ^{F}how to push ^{G}through \\
Carried away by a ^{C}moonlight ^{G}shadow \\
Carried away by a ^{C}moonlight ^{G}shadow \\
^{Am}Far ^{F}away on the ^{G}other side.
